# Linked List Project

## A simple linked list in JavaScript created using classes

This is a simple linked list created by using classes in javascript. It contains various methods
that you would expect for linked lists to have in other languages.

## Methods

- append(value) adds a new node containing value to the end of the list
- prepend(value) adds a new node containing value to the start of the list
- size returns the total number of nodes in the list
- head returns the first node in the list
- tail returns the last node in the list
- at(index) returns the node at the given index
- pop removes the last element from the list
- contains(value) returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.
- finds(value) returns the index of the node containing the value, or null if not found.
- toString represents the LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console. The format should be: ( value ) -> ( value ) -> ( value ) -> null

## Instructions

Make sure you have node installed and type in "node main.js" in the console without the quotes to run the code.
If you want to run your own tests just modify the main.js file with your custom tests.
